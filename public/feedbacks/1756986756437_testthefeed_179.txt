I'm testin if the feed back system really works. I've set the limit characters to 1000 letters. it should be enough ... i think. I should copy this text i case it doesn't work since one thousand characters is actually quite a huge amount of text. I don't think there will be anybody with that many things to say. Here at the end of this sentence i'll be at 372 characters. I think that's enough space. I wonder if should maybe limit it down cause it really is a lot of words already for just telling us an opinion we might get flooded with actual MSA requests and stories when this go live. Well let's wrapt this up here a 646 characters written.
